# SUBSCRIPTION PAGE ISSUES FOUND

## Problem 1: Wrong API Endpoint
**Frontend (SubscriptionPage.tsx line 50):**
- Calling: /subscription-plans
- Should be: /subscriptions/plans

**Backend Route (subscriptions.js line 8):**
- Defined as: /subscriptions/plans
- With baseURL becomes: http://localhost:5000/api/subscriptions/plans

## Problem 2: Endpoint Mismatch
Frontend: apiClient.get('/subscription-plans')
Backend: GET /api/subscriptions/plans

## Fix Required:
Change line 50 in SubscriptionPage.tsx from:
  apiClient.get('/subscription-plans')
To:
  apiClient.get('/subscriptions/plans')

## Testing:
1. Start backend: npm run dev (in backend folder)
2. Test endpoint: curl http://localhost:5000/api/subscriptions/plans
3. Expected: JSON with 3 plans (free, pro, team)

Would you like me to fix this now?
